## Important Assignment Info

Generate users here:
https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us
(use axios to request users with this URL)
Important data to display:
picture, first and last name, phone, email, and date of birth

**Note**

Use a table, since this is tabular data. :-)

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 
The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
